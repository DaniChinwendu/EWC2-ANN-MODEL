# EWC2-ANN-MODEL
A repo for the EWC artifical Neural network model for predicting EC3 Values For Skin Sensitization
The EWC-2 model is trained with the data obtained from the Direct peptide reactivity assay (DPRA),Human cell line activation assay data(h-CLAT) and ARE assay replaced with keratinosense TM assay. DPRA is an in-chemo assay that measure a substance ability to form hapten-protein complex, the human Cell line activation assay is an in-vitro test that accesses the ability of a substance to induce or mobilize dendric cells in the skin While keratinosense assay which mechanistically similar to ARE assay  measures the ability of a substance to activate the NFr2 pathway in keratinocytes.These tests are part of the integrated testing strategies for skin sensitization as stipulated by OECD as the relect important key events in the skin sensitization adverse outcome pathaway.
